Use Pandas and Numpy for data processing. Solve the four questions below: 
What was the maximum total revenue among all the shops in September, 2014? 
What item category generated the highest revenue in summer 2014? 
How many items are there, such that their price stays constant (to the best of our knowledge) during the whole period of time? 
What was the variance of the number of sold items per day sequence for the shop with shop_id = 25 in December, 2014? Do not count the items, that were sold but returned back later.
